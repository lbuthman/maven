- Refer to book for creating license, organization, and developers syntax in the POM.

- Example uses Dom4J and Jaxen for parsing XML, Velocity to format command-line output, and Log4J for logging. See book
for syntax and usage.

- Find useful plugins -> mvnrespoitory.com

- Directories not added automatically by plugin can be added manually.

- Find syntax for creating Velocity template and Log4J properties file.

- dependency:resolve -> see all dependencies for a project
- dependency:tree - easier to visualize relationships

- IOUtils has man static functions that make I/O easier. This is added as a test-scoped dependency in the POM. See book
for syntax.

- Often times, tests need dummy data and resources to complete their tests. The book creates a "resources" directory under
"scr/test". This is where Maven looks for unit test resources.

- Phases of the Maven Lifecycle can be skipped. Use this section as a reference for syntax.
