- Maven coordinates -> elements that uniquely identify a project: groupId, artifactId, packaging, version
  * there is a fifth, but is being skipped for now in the text
  
- name -> provides a human-readable name

- url -> associates the project with a project web site

- groupId -> group, company, team, organization, project, or other group

- artifactId -> represents a single project
