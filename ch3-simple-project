- Archetype -> an original model or type after which other similar things are patterened; a prototype

- A plugin has a prefix and a goal -> archetype:create

- The POM answers questions like: type of project, project name, and build customizations

- Maven coordinates: groupdId, artifactId, packaging, version

- Goals define parameters that can define sensible default values, thus achieving one example of "convention over configuration".

- When Maven executes a plugin goal, it looks to the POM for guidance and specification.

- In the POM, Maven coordinate identifiers are delimited by colons.

- When a "Mavenized" project is installed in a local repository, it becomes locally available to other projects that wish to
see it. To do this, merely add a dependency using the unique coordinates for a specific artifact.

- Many libraries required/used on a project are not free or public; these must be manually downloaded and installed or set to
the common repository. These are many products to help.

- Maven allows for transitive dependencies so that one dependency depends on other dependencies.

- Mave also allos for excluding dependencies from a projects class path.
