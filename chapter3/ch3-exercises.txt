1. IntelliJ has a number of provided archetypes given for free.
    -- explore each by creating a new sub-project
    -- take notes about concerning the online documentation

Solution Notes 1
    -- marmalade mojo was skipped because it has to do with game development
    -- Portlets was skipped because I read briefly about them and they don't seem relevant
        -> http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/java/archive/what-is-a-portlet.html
    -- There are no differences between "profiles" and "quickstart" archetypes.
    -- Spring OSGI Bundle seems to have a dependency in Eclipse. Seems kinda weird. I bet there are
    better Spring archetypes out there.
