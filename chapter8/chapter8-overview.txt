- As projects grow in complexity, it is important to refactor elements in the pom and look for duplication. This
chapter covers these cases and provides methods to do so correctly.

- One interesting point to call out concerns plugin dependencies. Because of transitive dependencies, many of the
dependencies of a project will grow over time. If a plugin is upgraded, it may not longer use a certain dependency,
leading to odd behavior as well as compilation and runtime errors.
